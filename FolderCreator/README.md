Folder Creator Script
This script creates six folders in your Unity project to help organize your assets and code files. The six folders are:

Textures
Scenes
Prefabs
Scripts
Plugins
Resources
Usage
To use this script in your Unity project, follow these steps:

Copy the FolderCreator.cs file to your project's Assets folder.
Attach the FolderCreator.cs script to a GameObject in your scene.
Run your Unity project.
When you run your Unity project, the FolderCreator.cs script will automatically create the six folders in your Assets folder if they don't already exist. The script logs messages to the console to let you know if the folders were created successfully or if they already existed.

Customization
If you want to customize the names or locations of the folders, you can modify the CreateFolder() method in the FolderCreator.cs file. The CreateFolder() method takes two parameters:

parentFolder: The path to the parent folder where you want to create the new folder.
folderName: The name of the new folder.
You can modify these parameters to create folders with different names or in different locations.
